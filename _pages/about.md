<div style="text-align: justify"> 
If we forget for a moment the philosophical implications of this question, I am a PhD student at [Carranza Lab](http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/carranza/index.html){:target="_blank"}, one of the research groups within the [Animal Biodiversity and Evolution Program](https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/animal-biodiversity-and-evolution){:target="_blank"} in the Insitute of Evolutionary Biology of Barcelona. Does that define me? For better or worse, I guess pretty much, at least these days. But I am also a music, book, film and nature lover. I think that is a fair summary of my interests. I am a part-time scientist (if that is ever possible), but a full-time learner.</div>



More about my research and scientific interests
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In my PhD project I explore the effect of the arid areas in the origin and maintenance of reptile diversity in Arabia and North Africa. I study biogeographic patterns and diversification dynamics applying Phylogenetic Comparative Methods to get a large-scale perspective. I am also working with specific genera of geckos to discover and describe unknown and cryptic diversity in those remote regions. This contributes to create an accurate and stable taxonomy, necessary for most evolutionary studies. 
Broadly speaking, I am interested in the evolution of taxa in space and time, and more specifically in how environmental conditions (geographic and climatic history) have affected diversification, as well as the interrelationships between ecological preferences, trait evolution and lineage diversification.

[//]: # (------)
[//]: # (For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).)

[//]: # (I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator)
[//]: # ( that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.)
