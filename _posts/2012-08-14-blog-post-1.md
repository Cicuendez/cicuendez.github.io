After the longest trip I've ever done, after spending the night at the airport in Barcelona to take the first flight of the day, after thinking I had missed the connection in Seattle because the police found it very weird and interesting and suspicious that I was coming for exactly ninety days, after realizing that my flight had been delayed and I still had time, after four hours at the Seattle airport waiting for the delayed flight, after arriving at Spokane and unsuccesfully being waiting for my luggage, and after finally meeting Luke Harmon himself again (sorry for the long wait, and thank you so much), I am at Moscow, (wait for it), Idaho, prepared for a three-month visit. 
Good morning, Moscow!
